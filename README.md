<h1>Iron Services Exposed</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Iron Services is a fake company. Hello, I am TessTickles#7452, the former owner of this business with founder naserbollara#1903. Just for some context, he stole this scam from a user named TMX (otherwise known as xservices).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does the scam work?</h2>
<p>Iron Services and xservices market their services as a FiveM spoofer, but in reality what is happening in the background is that they are not actually a spoofer and the plans are completely made up. Their method behind the spoofer is actually just a FiveM cleaner, and they use there rockstar account method (which I don't know much about) to actually unban people. It works definitely, but there scummy business practices are completely made up for money. You can manually delete the traces and login to the account provided and it will work just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Proof:</h2>
<p>I have a fully decompiled loader (the source code) and exact source code for it. The exact source code is: <a href="https://bigbrainguy1234.github.io/IronServicesScam/IronServicesDecompiled.rar">here </a></p>
<p>Look for your self, it has nothing to do with a kernel driver and is all bull shit. Do not buy this shit, if your going to purchase buy a rockstar account and delete the traces in the fake spoofer and then login. boom, ban removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't pay these guys there real scummy.&nbsp;</p>
